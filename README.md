# DFA-Accept-State-Tester
This program model takes a DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton) and tests accept strings of the associated language

(This is directly from my Theoretical Foundations final project)

Input: The program should take the DFA description from a text file that is specified as a
command line parameter. If this parameter is missing, the user should be prompted for
the data file. Strings to be tested for inclusion in the language should be entered
interactively by the user.
Output: For each string being tested, the program should indicate whether or not the
string is accepted.
